**🌐 Fetching Country Data**
The app uses the REST Countries API to get details about all countries (like name, flag, and population). This data loads as soon as the app opens, so it’s ready for you to browse!

**🖼️ Showing Countries on the Page**
The app displays each country as a "card" with a flag and name. Only a few cards are shown at first to keep things organized, and more appear when you click "Load More."

**🔍 Searching for a Country**
The search bar lets you type a country’s name to find it quickly. As you type, JavaScript instantly filters the list to show matching countries.

You can filter countries by region (like Asia or Europe) or by language. This makes it easy to focus on specific areas or languages. Just select your choice, and the app shows matching countries.

**❤️ Adding Favorites**
Click the heart icon on any country card to add it to your favorites. Your favorites are saved in your browser, so you can see them again even if you reload the page.
